I've spent most of my time using .NET's WCF to write the service layer. As I could write services faster than they were requested I began focusing my time on other spaces. Optimization and refactors of the service code, new languages as possible candidates for future rewrites (if it comes to that). I've found Google's Go to be a wonderful language for just this, and I'm also keeping my eye on Rust for when it matures a bit more. \r\n\r\nNever sitting still because my leg won't stop bouncing - Derek","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
