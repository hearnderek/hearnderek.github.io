        <p>Explosions, AI take over, and all done from a distance.</p>

<p>Started as a C++ programmer focused on making PC and Console games.</p>

<p>Moved onto C# within XNA and Unity to build games.</p>

<p>Began to focus on Game AI, Networking, Distributed Systems, and optimization.</p>

<p>Worked in the game industry for 6 months (till the project I joined ended) in Unreal </p>

<p>Pivoted over to the Mobile startup space with MeetBall as the Back-end dev. I've spent most of my time using .NET's WCF to write the service layer. As I could write services faster than they were requested I began focusing my time on other spaces. Optimization and refactors of the service code, new languages as possible candidates for future rewrites (if it comes to that). I've found Google's Go to be a wonderful language for just this, and I'm also keeping my eye on Rust for when it matures a bit more. </p>
